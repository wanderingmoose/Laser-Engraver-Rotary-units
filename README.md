# Laser-Engraver-Rotary-units
There are two designs. Each one has its marrets and can be be build usings off the shelf items, except the main aluminum plates that can be done either on a cnc router or a high power laser cutter or a water jet. And I even used acrylic to build a test unit. Options are what you decide.

V2 is a dual motor design that I reworked from a thingiverse unit. Search for 4896549 or wdwight. He did a great job. I could not get the same rails as he used, so I redesigned the plates to work with 2040 and 2020 carriage plates used with aluminum vslot.

V3 is still using 2040 and 2020 aluminum vslot, but make new custom plates, also did the design to use one stepper motor and belts.
